# This is the code for my Discord Chatbot, based on a dataset of MCU Thor's dialogue found from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pdunton/marvel-cinematic-universe-dialogue.
# This bot was made with the help of Lynn Zheng's tutorial https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/discord-ai-chatbot/ and this article https://towardsdatascience.com/make-your-own-rick-sanchez-bot-with-transformers-and-dialogpt-fine-tuning-f85e6d1f4e30
# In the future, I want to expand the model and make it more precise by training a larger GPT model - currently GPU limits are preventing this.
